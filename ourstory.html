            <p>we first met 13 years ago at the Sikh day parade in the city. We met through mutual friends. At the end of that day, we never met again until a few years later when our friends met and were hanging out, I was on the phone with my cousin and he happened to be there and thatâ€™s when we first spoke and exchanged numbers! After talking on the phone for a month daily, we finally decided to meet up. About time right? Lol he picked me up from my high school and we went to go eat. We spent a lot of time talking and getting to know each other better. We realized how many things we had in common, and how both of us were family-oriented and that is what we really liked about each other. This is when he had first asked me out and that is how our journey of love began from 10 years ago. Crazy right? </p>
